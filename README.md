# BellyButtons

Using Javascript and Plotly, I have taken the samples.json data and created a dashboard allowing the user to look at the bacteria sample information for each of the users who participated in the study.  The data is initially populated for participant #940, then can be changed using the dropdown selector to any of the other participants in the study.  There is a participant demographic info panel, a horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 bacteria for a participant, a bubble chart of the OTU IDs and sample values, and a gauge showing a participant's weekly washing frequency.  All 3 charts are automatically updated upon the change of the participant's ID number.

The web page has been deployed to github and can be accessed at the web address below....
